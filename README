Twittduino:

Display an twitter feed on a Serial lcd

Requirements:

	Arduino Decimillia or compatible clone

	Sparkfun's 20x4 LCD  
	http://www.sparkfun.com/commerce/product_info.php?products_id=462

Usage:
	First program your arduino with Twitduino.pde
	Then using Arduino's IDE or other program get the path to
	the Arduino's serial port (/dev/tty.usbserial-A60049lS on my mac)

	Edit twittduino.py so the serial line has your serial port's path
	(line 13)
	
	Then edit line 18 and change USERNAME and PASSWORD with your 
	Twitter info.

	Then go to a console and run python twittduino.py to read your messages.
	
	Make sure your LCD is configured to the right baud rate before starting the
	program and properly connected (lcd's TTL to arduino's TX, +5V to 5V and GND to Gnd)
